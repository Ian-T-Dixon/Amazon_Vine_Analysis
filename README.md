# Amazon Review Analysis
## Overview
For this project we are using Google Colab to analyze data from Amazon Reviews. Using the data, we are looking to answer the following question: Is there any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results:
- <b>How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?</b>

  - Total Paid(Vine) Reviews: 94

  - Total Unpaid(Non Vine) Reviews: 40471

- <b>How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?</b>
  - Total Paid 5-Star Reviews: 48

  - Total Unpaid 5-Star Reviews: 15663
  
- <b>What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?</b>

  - Percent of paid 5-star reviews: 51.06 %

  - Percent of unpaid 5-star reviews: 38.70 %

## Summary
Based on the analysis, we can determine that the vine program may have a positive bias in the review as seen by the 13% jump in 5 star reviews compared to the non-vine. However, as the number of vine reviews is significantly smaller than the non-vine, this could account for the higher percentages. I would also like to analyze the data taking into account which reviews were a verified purchase to see what percentage of the 5-star reviews were verified vs not.
